> # _**EDA for cardiovascular disease dataset**_

## **_Abstract:_**
***
_The goal of this project was to analyze and explore data to understand which features have a high and direct effect on cardiovascular disease and also to analyze other features to understand their effects, some of which had an effect on another feature that had a high effect on cardiovascular disease, and some of which had a small effect on the final outcome. And also, understand the data clearly and represent it with graphics to illustrate the relationships and their distribution. Through the apparent results, it was found that the analyses were correct due to their compatibility with the medical information published about the disease._
_This project was done using the Cardiovascular Disease dataset from Kaggle:_

## _**Components:**_
### **_Design:_**
***
_By measuring the relationship between features and cardiovascular disease and understanding the relationships between features, this will help us understand the factors causing cardiovascular disease and the proportion of each of them to the occurrence of the disease, and through this we must avoid them and try to reduce them if they are in a direct relationship with cardiovascular disease, And not to ignore the other features that are an indirect factor in the occurrence of the disease, An early understanding of the factors helps us detect cardiovascular disease before complications of the disease occur._

***

### _**Data:**_
***
_The dataset contains 70,000 observations and 13 features, including Objective Features (Age, Height, Weight, Gender), Examination Features (Systolic blood pressure, Diastolic blood pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose), and Subjective Features (Smoking, alcohol intake, as well as a Subjective Feature that includes Physical activity and Target Variable: Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease._

***

### _**Algorithms:**_
***
_Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis of the cardiovascular disease dataset, explore and clean, and perform combinations, aggregate and visualize, analysis to understand the relationships between the data and their effect on cardiovascular disease._

***

### _**Tools:**_
***
_Numpy and Pandas for Data Manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualization, Sqlite3 for Database, Programs: Jupyter Notebook, SQLite._

***


### _**Communication:**_
***
_Present a 5-minute slide presentation and a one-page report summarizing the project, beginning with an abstract and detailing the project, including the five major components._
_Also, my project will be included on my GitHub page._
